# PLU-simulator

When i started working extra in a food-store the biggest learning curve was all of the PLU codes for different fruits and such. 
The store has an old system with requires you to manually input the PLU codes to the system. But no practice tool for them. 
Så i created this one. 


Orignial version was made with PHP and a database in mySQL. But for a easier time taking the page online so others in the same situation like me can use it.  I rewrote the code and used a JS-object to store it all of the data about PLU-codes.  

The site is constructed in a simple fashion with some interactive functions like a streak-count, my tought being this would make it more fun to learn. 

I'm posting all of the PLU-codes down below if anyone wants to try it out.
